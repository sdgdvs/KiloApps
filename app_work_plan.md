# App Work Plan

## Coordination Rules (DO NOT DELETE — required for subagent context)

**Multi-Agent System:** 4 agents operate on this repo on overlapping schedules. You are the **App Builder**.
- **PATH Restore** (run before any git/npm command): `$env:Path = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","Machine") + ";" + [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","User");`
- **Always `git pull`** before reading or editing files. Other agents push changes between your turns.
- **Plan file ownership — only edit YOUR file (`app_work_plan.md`).** Read but NEVER edit:
  - `app_fix_plan.md` (QA agent), `kiloos_ux_plan.md` (UX agent), `game_content_plan.md` (Games agent)
- **Shared file `KiloOS/src/App.jsx`** — owned by the UX agent. You may ONLY add entries to the APPS array. Protocol: `git pull` → make minimal APPS-only change → commit and push IMMEDIATELY before doing other work.
- **`KiloOS/src/index.css`** — owned by the UX agent. Do NOT edit.
- **App folder categories** for the `folder` property in APPS: `System`, `Media`, `Office`, `Games`, `Network`, `Dev`.
- **Dual-target model:** Each app has a native C version (`K[Name]/main.c` + `build.bat`) and a web HTML5 version (`KiloOS/public/apps/k[name].html`). Both versions should offer functional parity where feasible. Web HTML files must be single self-contained files (inline CSS + JS, no imports).
- **Size limit:** No individual KiloApp may exceed 999 kilobytes (web or native).
- **Testing:** After editing HTML → verify in browser if possible. After editing App.jsx → `cd KiloOS && npm run build`. After editing `.c` files → run the app's `build.bat`.
- **Version bumping:** If you modify KiloOS shell files, bump the patch version in `KiloOS/package.json`.
- **CI/CD:** Every push to `main` triggers GitHub Actions → Firebase deploy to `kiloapps.web.app`.
- **Conflict resolution:** If `git push` fails → `git pull --rebase` → resolve conservatively (prefer remote for code you didn't write) → push again.
- **Logging discipline:** Keep this plan file concise. A few lines per completed item. Do NOT dump file contents or create verbose logs.
