# App Testing & UI Audit Plan

## Coordination Rules (DO NOT DELETE — required for subagent context)

**Multi-Agent System:** Multiple worker agents + directors operate on this repo on overlapping schedules. You are the **App Tester** agent.
- **Always `git pull`** before reading or editing files. Other agents push changes between your turns.
- **Plan file ownership — only edit YOUR file (`app_test_plan.md`).** Read but NEVER edit:
  - `app_fix_plan.md` (QA agent), `app_work_plan.md` (Feature Expander — paused), `game_content_plan.md` (Games — paused), `new_app_plan.md` (Creator), `usability_plan.md` (Usability)
- **Shared file `KiloOS/src/App.jsx`** — Do NOT edit unless fixing a broken app registration entry.
- **`KiloOS/src/index.css`** — Do NOT edit.
- **Size limit:** No individual KiloApp may exceed 999 kilobytes (web or native).
- **Testing:** After editing any app's HTML file, verify it renders. After editing `App.jsx` → `npm run build` in `KiloOS/`.
- **CI/CD:** Every push to `main` triggers GitHub Actions → Firebase deploy to `kiloapps.web.app`. If build fails, fix immediately.
- **Conflict resolution:** If `git push` fails → `git pull --rebase` → resolve conservatively (prefer remote for code you didn't write) → push again.
- **Logging discipline:** Keep this plan file concise. Use the compact report format specified below.

## ⏱️ TURN SCOPING & TERMINATION (CRITICAL — READ EVERY TURN)

**Single-Item-Per-Turn Rule:**
- Each cron trigger = ONE turn. Audit exactly ONE app from your queue, then STOP.
- "Loop forever" means the CRON loops forever across turns, NOT that you loop within a single turn.
- After committing and pushing your work for ONE app, STOP CALLING TOOLS immediately.

**Graceful Termination Checklist (do this EVERY turn before stopping):**
1. Audited one app
2. Updated this plan file with test report
3. Fixed trivial issues in-line (if any)
4. Committed and pushed
5. STOP — call no more tools

## ⚠️ DIRECTOR NOTE: WHY THIS AGENT EXISTS

Apps have accumulated many non-functional UI elements — buttons with no handlers, modals that won't open, menu items that throw errors, import/export features that silently fail, settings that don't persist. The QA agent catches code-level bugs (memory leaks, XSS, buffer overflows) but does NOT systematically interact with every UI element. This agent fills that gap.

**Your job is to be a THOROUGH MANUAL TESTER, not a code auditor.** The QA agent already does code auditing. You focus on the USER EXPERIENCE: does every visible button, link, control, modal, tab, dropdown, and feature ACTUALLY WORK when a user interacts with it?

## Testing Methodology (follow this for EVERY app)

### Step 1: Inventory All UI Elements (WEB VERSION ONLY — focus on web HTML apps)
Read the app's web HTML file (`KiloOS/public/apps/k[name].html`) and identify EVERY interactive element:
- Buttons (including toolbar, modal, and inline buttons)
- Input fields, dropdowns, checkboxes, sliders
- Tabs and navigation controls
- Modals and dialogs (do they open? do they close? do their buttons work?)
- Import/Export features (CSV, JSON, TXT, etc.)
- Keyboard shortcuts listed in help
- Settings that claim to be saved/loaded

### Step 2: Trace Each Element's Handler
For each interactive element, trace its event handler in the JavaScript:
- Does the `onclick`/`addEventListener` reference a function that EXISTS?
- Does that function DO SOMETHING MEANINGFUL, or is it a stub/empty?
- Does it reference variables or DOM elements that exist?
- Will it throw an error on typical input?

### Step 3: Classify Issues
For each issue found, classify it:
- **🔧 FIXED** — You fixed it in-line (≤5 lines, single file, obvious fix like removing a dead button or wiring up a missing handler)
- **❌ BROKEN** — Complex issue, logged for QA agent to fix. Describe the symptom clearly.
- **⚠️ STUB** — Feature is declared in UI but implementation is empty/placeholder. Note whether it should be removed or completed.
- **✅ OK** — Element works as expected.

### Step 4: Fix Trivial Issues In-Line
If you find a button referencing a nonexistent function, you may:
- **Remove the button** if the feature doesn't exist
- **Wire it up** if the function exists but isn't connected (e.g., typo in handler name)
- **Add a basic stub** like `alert('Not yet implemented')` only if the feature is partially built

**DO NOT** do large rewrites. If a fix would be >5 lines or touch multiple functions, log it for QA.

### Step 5: Write Compact Test Report
Add an entry to the Test Reports section below using this format:
```
- **KAppName**: [PASS ✅ | ISSUES FOUND ⚠️] (N issues, M fixed inline)
  - ✅ Core functionality works (describe briefly)
  - ❌ "Export CSV" button: onclick calls exportCSV() which doesn't exist
  - ⚠️ "Settings" modal: opens but Save button is a no-op stub
  - 🔧 FIXED: Removed orphan "Share" button with no handler
```
